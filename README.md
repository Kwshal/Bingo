# Bingo
Multiplayer realistic Bingo notebook. 

Players will cross a number which will be shown on the top status bar which is also editable by tapping for messaging. I'm trying to make it as realistic as possible which also means cheating like in real life is easily possible which adds a real life element. Players will tap the bingo button on winning which is available even if it's not bingo and can be clicked without. Remaining numbers are shown after the game ends or is finished if asked by the other player.
